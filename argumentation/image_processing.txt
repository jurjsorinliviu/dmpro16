We chose to do image processing on EFM32, the microcontroller. There are       
several reasons for this. 
1. We believe that this is more energy-efficient than doing this on the FPGA.
2. Making it work is more important than doing it efficient. Recognizing the 
sudoku board is, from our point of view, easier to implement on the EFM32. 
Several group members have experience with micro-controller programming. 
3. It seems that there are more libraries available for the EFM32 than the
FPGA, like for example OpenCV.
