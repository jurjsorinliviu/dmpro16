PCB:
* Thermal baking
	Noone knows what this is, and apparently the camera and FPGA has
	different thermal profiles.
	LUDVIG FIX

FPGA:
* Flash
	We need a flash to program the fpga each time it is turned on.
	Moving the file from flash to fpga takes a long time, but we don't
	want to have a 32 bit wide bus for this either. A 4 bit bus wouldn't
	be too slow. Edgar finds and Arne researches flash.

* Bus
	We need some reserve signals between MCU and FPGA. In addition to
	SPI bus. A 16-bit wide bus between FPGA and MCU would be nice.

* Image
	Do we really need to operate on 4-bit grayscale? BNN and corner
	recognition operates on 1-bit. Katrine looks at pictures and
	number of bits needed.

Camera:
* Clock
	The camera needs a 24MHz clock.
	This is incidentally exactly half of the MCU clock.

* Protocol
	The camera should _not_ be moved to the MCU. In the extreme case we
	can control the camera from MCU through the FPGA.

MCU:
* JTAG
	We still don't know how to program the MCU. We need a way to flash
	the MCU, possibly JTAG. Send a mail to Yaman.
