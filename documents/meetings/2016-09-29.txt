!Design review 2016-09-29

Comments on the delivered slides:
* Text on slide 2 is not consistent with figure on slide 3.
    - The figure is correct. Old text
* The structure can be improved.
* Still missing expected energy consumption
    - How much power does one sudoku need?
    - Nice to compare with in the presentation at the end

PCB:

* Camera:
    - Thermal baking. DIfferent baking profiles. Think about it.
        # Think about it as making a frozen grandiosa and a homemade
          pizza in the same oven at the same time
    - RPi camera is bad, but let's keep for backup
    - The protocol for the camera
        # This may be complex
            & Should the camera be moved to the MCU?
            & Probably fine to just route it via the FPGA to the MCU
                Â¤ Should add more lines between FPGA and MCU
* How do we measure the power consumption?
* Use money, make it simple
* Alternate power
* Screen
    - Is bankers, but pins on the MCU end needs changing. See irclogs
* Unused pins
    - Route a bunch to testpoints
        # Enough to be flexible
        # Not too many, routing will be a hassle
* Bus between FPGA and MCU
    - Should we add another bus+
        # We don't need to use it
        # Nice backup, so we don't put all our eggs in the SPI-basket
* Does the MCU have j-tag?
    - Doesn't seem like it
    - Send an epost to Yaman and ask.
* Oscilator for the MCU
    - It's possible to use the internal oscilator
        # But it will probably be pain
            & 'In worst case, use the internal oscilator'
        # Can we use the same oscilator as the FPGA?
* Gunnar
    - Talk with Gunnar today
* Flashing the FPGA
    - Should probably add a flash so the FPGA can be flashed
* Wiring
    - This should probably wire nice
    - Be prepared for manual routing
* Delivery of the PCB
    ll:
    - Send it to Gunnar
    - He will note what's bad
    - We will fix
    - GOTO: ll
    - When all is good, zip'it and upload to itslearning
