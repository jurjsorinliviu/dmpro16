Meeting 2016-09-15
===================

Requirements for camera image:
 - Everything but sudoku board square is black
 - The camera is angled orthogonally towards the board (but may be rotated
   along this axis).

Camera image will be stored in 4-bit grayscale (converted on the fly on the
FPGA) on the EFM32.

The preprocessing will happen on the EFM32
