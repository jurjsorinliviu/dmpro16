Tasks
===========

 - PCB - Design of PCB, connections between components etc.

 - FPGA - Implementation of BNN on the FPGA and associated connections/data

 - Pre-processing - Design system (primarily on the EFM32) for going from raw
   camera data to 81 images suitable for the BNN

 - Post-processing - Design system (on the EFM32) for going from 81 numbers
   from the BNN through checking the sudoku solution and displaying this
   in some form to the user

 - Flow&R - Managing the program and data flow (interupts, state diagram ++)
   and doing research (figuring out which potential solution to a problem is
   the most energy effective for instance)
