Argumentation
==============

The camera and SD-card are connected to a bus accessible by both the FPGA and
EFM32. This is because we at this point do not know where we will do the first
processing of the raw images. We also discussed a physical plug for the camera,
but decided that this did not pose an advantage, but introduced the plug itself
as a potential point of failure. This may not be in the end product, but as we
at this point do not know where the preprocessing will be most effective we
have this solution as of now.

The output-peripherals (display, serial and LEDs) are connected to the EFM32.
The EFM32 is the I/O processor, and interfacing at least the display seems more
practical on the EFM32. The display is the primary output. The serial is
provided for outputting debug info to a console. The LEDs are also planned for
debugging, and as a fallback for user feedback in case the display fails.

SRAM is drawn as [SRAM?] becuase we have still not decided which camera module
to use, and the amount of memory required is decided by the size of the
smallest usable unprocessed image from the camera. The camera resolution also
depends on the requirements of how well the sudo -ku board fits the camera
sensor. This is also connected to both FPGA and EFM32 for the same reasons as
the camera/SD-card.

The big, red button (ACTIVATE) is connected, as of now, to both the FPGA and
EFM32 because we do not know which of them will wake first; this also depends
on whichever will do the initial processing. The other buttons are connected
only to the EFM32 and are meant for debugging/additional input.
