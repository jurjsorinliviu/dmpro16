The recommended power-on sequence is VCCINT, VCCBRAM, VCCAUX, and 
VCCO to achieve minimum current draw and ensure that the I/Os are 
3-stated at power-on. The recommended power-off sequence is the 
reverse of the power-on sequence. If VCCINT and VCCBRAM have the 
same recommended voltage levelsthen both can be powered by the 
same supply and ramped simultaneously. If VCCAUX and VCCO have 
the same recommended voltage levels then both can be powered by 
the same supply and ramped simultaneously.

**Pins JTAG uses:**
CFGBVS: High when we use 2.5V or 3.3V (connected to VCCO_0)

M[2:0]:
Input pins M[2:0]. The M2, M1, and M0 mode pins should be set at a 
constant DC voltage level, either through pull-up or pull-down 
resistors (≤ 1kΩ), or tied directly to ground or VCCO_0. 
The mode pins should not be toggled during and after configuration. 

TCK: Test clock
TMS: Test mode select
TDI: Test data input
TDO: Test data output

JTAG to FPGA:
data_out -> TDI
mode_select -> TMS
clock -> TCK
data_in -> TDO

PROGRAM_B: 
Active-Low reset to configuration logic. When 
PROGRAM_B is pulsed Low, the FPGA configuration is 
cleared and a new configuration sequence is initiated. 
Configuration reset initiated upon falling edge, and 
configuration (i.e. programming) sequence begins upon 
the following rising edge. 
Connect PROGRAM_B to an external ≤ 4.7 kΩ pull-up resistor 
to VCCO_0 to ensure a stable High input, and recommend 
push-button to GND to enable manual configuration reset.

INIT_B: 
Active-Low FPGA initialization pin or configuration error signal.
The FPGA drives this pin Low when the FPGA is in a configuration 
resetstate, when the FPGA is initializing (clearing) its
configuration memory, or when the FPGA has detected a configuration
error. Upon completing the FPGA initialization process, INIT_B is 
released to high-impedance at which time an external resistor 
is expected to pull INIT_B High. INIT_B can externally be held Low
during power-up to stall the power-on configuration sequence at the
end of the initialization process. When a High is detected at the
INIT_B input after the initialization process, the FPGA proceeds
with the remainder of the configuration sequence dictated by the
[2:0] pin settings.Connect INIT_B to a ≤ 4.7 kΩ pull-up resistor to
VCCO_0 to ensure clean Low-to-High transitions.

DONE: 
A High signal on the DONE pin indicates completion of 
the configuration sequence. The DONE output is an 
open-drain output by default.

PUDC_B:
Probably connected to ground?
