Small tasks that need to be done in order to start drawing PCB:
* Verify that all component footprints are available and correct.
* Find which MCU pin on EFM32GG990 that can accept a clock signal.
* Draw camera schematic symbol.
* Connect camera schematic symbol.
* Connect pins FPGA Config section.
* Draw FPGA Config Flash schematic symbol.
* Draw FPGA JTAG header schematic symbol.
* Figure out way of measuring current comsumption on each voltage rail.
