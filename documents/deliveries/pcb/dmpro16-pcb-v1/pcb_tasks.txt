Small tasks that need to be done in order to start drawing PCB:
* Verify that all component footprints are available and correct.
* Find which MCU pin on EFM32GG990 that can accept a clock signal.
    - We can use PB14 (PB14 is high frequence, PB8 is low frequence)
* Draw camera schematic symbol.
* Connect camera schematic symbol.
X Connect pins FPGA Config section.
    - Take this dirrectly from the other group, they have done it right
* Draw FPGA Config Flash schematic symbol.
    - Take from the other group, they have done this
* Draw FPGA JTAG header schematic symbol.
    - Take from the other group, they have done this
* Figure out way of measuring current comsumption on each voltage rail.
    - We use INA19x current sense amplifiers.
